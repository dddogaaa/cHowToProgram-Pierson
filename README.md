# C How to Program 8th Edition Examples and Exercises

Welcome to the repository for the figures and exercises from the book "C How to Program, 8th Edition" by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel. This repository contains a collection of code examples and exercises that accompany the book, as well as additional external examples from my university.

## About the Book

"C How to Program" is a comprehensive guide to learning the C programming language. The 8th edition of this book provides a hands-on approach to programming in C, covering topics ranging from basic syntax and control structures to advanced concepts such as pointers, arrays, and file handling.

## Repository Contents

### Figures

The "figures" directory contains graphical illustrations, diagrams, and flowcharts referred to in the book. These figures provide visual representations of various programming concepts and help enhance the understanding of the material.

### Figures

The directory includes a collection of coding exercises presented in the book. These exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts discussed in each chapter and provide opportunities for practice and experimentation.

### External Examples

In addition to the book's examples and exercises, this repository also includes external examples from my university. These examples have been added to further expand the range of programming scenarios and provide additional learning materials specific to course.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code examples and exercises in this repository. You can navigate through the directories to find the relevant materials for your study or programming practice.

Please note that the code examples and exercises are organized according to the chapters and sections of the book. You may find subdirectories within the "exercises" directory, corresponding to different chapters or exercise categories. The external examples from university class are located in a separate directory, labeled to distinguish them from the book's materials.

You are encouraged to study and experiment with both the book's examples/exercises and the external examples to deepen your understanding of C programming concepts and improve your coding skills.

## Adding External Examples

If you wish to contribute additional examples from your university class to this repository, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new directory within the repository, clearly indicating that it contains the external examples from your university class.
2. Organize the examples within this directory according to the appropriate chapters or topics covered in your class.
3. Include a README file within the directory, providing a brief overview of the examples and any necessary instructions for running or understanding the code.
4. Make sure the code is well-commented and properly documented to facilitate comprehension for other users.
5. If possible, include any relevant reference materials or links to additional resources that may aid in understanding the examples.

Once you have added the external examples, you can submit a pull request to have them merged into the main repository. Your contributions will be reviewed, and if accepted, they will become part of the shared resources available to other users.

## Getting Started

To make the best use of this repository, you should have a basic understanding of the C programming language. If you are new to C, it is recommended to first study the book "C How to Program, 8th Edition" by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel.
